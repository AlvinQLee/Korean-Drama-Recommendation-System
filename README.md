# Project Goal
In the age of big data, many organizations generate growth by analyzing its data. These companies have information about its products and services, buyers and suppliers, as well as consumer preferences. When was the last time you saw ads on the side of your browser about products you had recently searched up?

Combining my love for entertainment (specifically gaming and watching korean dramas) and interest in working with consumer information, I decided to do my Research and Publication project on building a K-drama recommendation system. To achieve this, I researched different types of filtering methods and implemented one known as the content-based filtering method. The goal of this project is to be able to understand the processes behind the recommendation of a product.

# Conclusion
All in all, this project was a success. My main objective was to implement a content-based filtering method that would be able to recommend K-dramas given a title of a korean drama. As a next step, I would definitely find a better source of data since the dynamic nature of Wikipedia makes the data collection process inefficient. In addition, I could build a website that would recommend K-dramas to present it in a more visually appealing way. Lastly, I could implement other filtering methods given new data such as ratings and user history.
